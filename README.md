# CryptoGUI
---
This is a small application I built using a Python module called tkinter to demonstrate some cryptography techniques.
---
# What I Learned
* How to use tkinter to create quick GUIs for Python (used Buttons, Labels, Entry Fields)
* Basics of Cryptography (terminology, famous ciphers, etc.)
---
# Features
* Caesar Cipher demo- performs a simple substitution cipher where the characters are all shifted by a key
* Frequency Analysis- select a text file and count the occurence of characters in the file
