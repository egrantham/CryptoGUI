# CryptoGUI

This is a small application I built using a Python module called tkinter to demonstrate some cryptography techniques. 

# To Run The Program

1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure you have installed a recent version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). As of writing this I believe 3.7 or later should be fine. 
3. Run the TabWidget.py file from the command line or your favorite IDE! 

# What I Learned

* How to use tkinter to create quick GUIs for Python (used Buttons, Labels, Entry Fields, filedialog)
* How to embed graphs into tkinter using matplotlib
* Basics of Cryptography (terminology, famous ciphers, etc.)

# Features

* Caesar Cipher- performs a simple substitution cipher where the characters are all shifted by a key. Allows users to select files as input or manually enter text, and save the resulting text. 
* Frequency Analysis- select a text file and count the occurence of characters in the file, plots a bar chart.


# Further Reading

I learned about a lot of this content from The Code Book by Simon Singh, which also goes further into depth. It's a bit old (published around 2000), but if you're curious about this topic I highly recommend it!
